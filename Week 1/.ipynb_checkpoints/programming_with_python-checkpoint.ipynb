    "    into one of the most perennially popular computer languages today\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Python?\n",
    "  \n",
    " Python is a great programming language to learn. Here are some reasons why:\n",
    "  \n",
    "  1. Python is free. It costs you nothing to down load and use it.\n",
    "     \n",
    "  2. Python is simple. Python statements are simple to read, understand, and use, even for new\n",
    "       programmers. Python is simple enough for beginners, yet advanced enough for experienced programmers.\n",
    "     \n",
    "  3. Python is avail able on most plat forms. Python is available on the major computing\n",
    "       platforms such as Windows, Mac,and Linux.\n",
    "     \n",
    "  4. Python has an extensive standard library. Python comes with lots of built-in functions,\n",
    "       procedures, and  properties  common programming tasks.\n",
    "     \n",
    "  5. Python is extensible. You can create your own Python library modules and\n",
    "        access the many existing third-party modules.\n",
    "     \n",
    "  6. Python is popular. According to the 2018 Stack Over flow Developer Survey, Python is\n",
    "        one of the most popular and fastest-growing programming languages to day.\n",
    "       \n",
    "\n",
    "### How to run python on your machine\n",
    "\n",
    "   Conda is a tool that comes with python and other useful libraries preinstalled. We also use \n",
    "   for creating virtual environments.\n",
    "  \n",
    "   1. Go to https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html#windows-installers\n",

    "   \n",
    "   4. On the computer double-click the .exe file. If we are unsure about any setting, accept the defaults.\n",
    "       We can change them later.\n",
    "   \n",
    "   5. Follow the instructions on the screen.\n",

    "\n",
    "   2. Identifiers: Names given to variables, functions, classes, or other entities in the code. Identifiers must follow certain rules and  conventions specified by the language.\n",
    "\n",
    "   3. Literals: Literal values, such as numbers, strings, or boolean values, that represent themselves in the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "   4. Operators: Symbols used to perform operations on operands, such as arithmetic operators (+, -, *, /), comparison operators\n",
    "      (==, !=, <,  >), and logical operators (and, or, not).\n",
    "\n",
    "   5. Punctuation: Special symbols used to separate or group elements in the code, such as parentheses (), braces {},\n",
    "      brackets [], commas ,, semicolons ;, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "   6. Comments: Text in the code that is ignored by the compiler or interpreter and serves as documentation or notes for human readers.\n",
